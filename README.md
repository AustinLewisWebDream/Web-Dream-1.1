# Web Dream
> Full stack web application built with the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. This application was originally intended to be used for my personal business "Web Dream", which provided web hosting services and custom web design services. Since Web Dream has been dissolved, this application has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained. 

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
